I will offer a counter-position here. First off, I believe that one should definitely discuss this situation when you begin taking such pictures with your partner, or even before any pictures actually get taken. If your partner says they do not want you keeping the pictures if you break up, you should honour that and delete them when you do break up. If you don't discuss the matter before breaking up, then you should still ask, or just outright delete them, but either way never keep such pictures without permission. I'll explain my reasoning a bit.
