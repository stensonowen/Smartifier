I feel like something is left out when you simply tack it onto the end of a longer thought without a smooth transition. Any stand-up comedian worth their salt will tell you to open up with a few short one-liners to get the audience in the mood to laugh. Then you can take the time to set up a more nuanced, delayed punchline without losing them in the process. In fact, the joke will often be even more successful if you can succeed in getting them to completely forget that they're waiting for a punchline at all. You want the story to last just long enough that your audience begins to slide back into their comfort zones and that's when you fuck her right in the pussy.
